# Kyubu Wheato!
Take Back the Wheat! x Kyubu Kyubu Dice

A collaboration between the roguelite top-down shooter and the isometric arcade puzzle game, Kyubu Wheato! introduces our adorable protagonist, Teresa-chan, to an entirely new world filled with baddies. She prides herself in helping the innocent, and this is no exception. 

# Combat
She uses her trusty Kyubu Kyubu Dice to obliterate her enemies, taking back the wheat that once belonged to Steve the farmer. Unlock powerful (and delicious) entrees that grant useful abilities in taking down enemies. Combine strategy with utter randomness and chaos to use a rather unique combat system!

# Levels
Unlike roguelites with procedural generations, this game consists of 10 main handcrafted levels, including a boss level at the end. Teresa-chan's goal is to retrieve that precious golden wheat bundle while stuffing the baddies' faces with dice, and her own face with Pastel de Choclo.

# Boss Fight!
Can you defeat the almighty farmer who stole the golden wheat away from Steve? With 8 unique and brutal attacks up his sleeves, it seems that you might have to play smarter, not harde- nah just spam dice and get really buffed beforehand

# Inspiration
Eldelnacho and his game, Kyubu Kyubu Dice, gave heavy inspiration in the making of this game, alongside Holocure and Muck. Please give Eldel's arcade game a try here: https://eldelnacho.itch.io/kyubu-kyubu-dice.
Besides him, be sure to check out Holocure by Kay Yu too, as it is one of the games that inspired me to make this the most! https://kay-yu.itch.io/holocure

I really hope you enjoy my first big game and first big programming project that I collaborated on with ScarBorrower and dedicated nearly 3 months of my life doing. Thank you for at least reading 'till the end. I am happy.
